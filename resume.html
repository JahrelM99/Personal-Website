                LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FOR JAHREL MOYENDA</i>
            </p>
            
            <p>It is my pleasure to recommend Jahrel Moyenda for a computer programming position. I have been Jahrelâ€™s English teacher since August 2016 when he enrolled in the Web Application Development lab at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART).</p>

            <p>Jahrel will make an excellent employee due to is his outstanding work ethic, positive attitude, and leadership skills.  I have the pleasure of working with Jahrel for three hours each day. He is very mature for his age and produces exemplary work. I am not surprised that he has maintained a 4.0 grade point average throughout high school.</p>

            <p>Next, Jahrel has learned a great deal about website development in the short time school has been in session. He has created several websites already using html, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, he has learned how to use wireframes to plan websites and brackets to enhance his final products. The focus of these websites include a country of choice, an endangered species, and a personal website to showcase his professional portfolio, technology skills, and writing abilities. Soon, he will work with a team and a business owner to develop a website for a real-world company. Furthermore, he knows how to use Microsoft Office and Adobe programs.</p>

            <p>In addition to his academic success, Jahrel is extremely active. He has a great deal of volunteer experience, has served on many committees, is active in many clubs, and has represented his high school in a variety of academic and leadership roles.</p>

            <p>I gladly recommend Jahrel for a computer programming position. He works hard and willingly collaborates with others. He consistently remains focused on his work, has excellent attendance, and is a pleasure to have in class.  In closing, he is passionate about technology and has a love of learning.</p>

                To Whom It May Concern:</i> 
            </p>

            <p>I am writing in reference to Jahrel Moyenda. He is an extremely intelligent, thoughtful, and articulate individual. I have known Jahrel for nearly 2 years and have observed first-hand the manner in which he works well with others and often emerges as a leader when working cooperatively with his peers. He is admired and respected by his teachers and classmates for his generally positive disposition. It is evident that Mr. Moyenda is not only a well-liked person, but he possesses exceptional abilities as well as endearing qualities that allow him to excel in any group.</p> 

            <p>Jahrel has displayed a keen desire for personal success and achievement often pushing himself not only to participate in new and challenging experiences, but to thrive among the elite. He has worked to overcome his apprehension of speaking publicly and has greatly advanced his oratory skills. He has also diligently applied himself in improving his writing by enrolling in AP courses. He is clearly among the most competent writers that Iâ€™ve taught in the last 20 years.</p> 

            <p>Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of instructing Jahrel, and his contributions to our class were invaluable. His responses, both verbal and written, were insightful and comprehensive, usually setting the standard among his classmates. I am convinced that he will be successful in all that he sincerely attempts, because he has proven that his potential is limitless. Therefore, I give him my highest recommendation.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br> 
            Rodney A. Branch,<br> 
                English Teacher</p>
