                <h3>Writing Sample 1: Product Review of Samsung Galaxy S6</h3>
                <p>It was around February 2016 that I got my Samsung Galaxy S6—the predecessor to the Galaxy S7. I got it just before the S7 came out, and felt no compunction getting the older model. I believe the Galaxy S6 is an amazing phone like no other. It has the beauty, snappy performance, and is just a pleasure to use on a daily basis.</p>
                
                <p>The Samsung Galaxy S6 has an abundance of innovative features that make it a pleasure to use. Going with the gold model, I noticed it has an iridescent, shimmering glow in direct sunlight—a bonus that adds to the overall aesthetic of the phone. It has two glass panels on the front and back and an aluminum band that wraps around the edges. The phone is light and comfortable to hold in the hand. The S6 packs a beautiful, quad HD, AMOLED screen that is vibrant and crisp, and has a high color saturation. It is powered my Samsung’s very own octa-core Exynos processor, has 32 GB of ROM, 4 GB of RAM, and runs the software version Android Marshmallow.</p>
                
                <p>Upon using the phone, I notice little lag, and the performance is smooth. I can run all of my applications and multitask seamlessly without any disruptions. The Galaxy S6 has made my academic and business life easier. I use it to research on the web, organize my files and classwork, and keeps all my contacts in one place for easy access.</p>
                
                <p>Aside from business, I use my Galaxy S6 for entertainment, and well, just about everything else. From social media to ordering Chinese take-out, my phone makes my life easier and allows me to stay in tune with the rapid advancements in technology.</p>

                    <h3>Writing Sample 2: Lost in Cyberspace</h3>

	               <p>In retrospect, ever since I was a young child, I've always had an affinity for technology.
                    As a kid, I was a lot more interested in computers, Ipods, and cellphones than coloring mandalas 
                    or playing tag with a bunch of rambunctious elementary schoolers.</p>

                    <p>I remember going to the computer lab with my class in the 3rd grade to play educational 
                    games and practice my typing skills. Being on the desktop computers was the best part of my 
                    whole elementary school career; one of the only things I looked forward to. I would always race 
                    before my class to the computer lab, which was a large room with a serene ambiance that would 
                    always welcome students and faculty. In the room were tons of old school Macintoshes set on 
                    desks that were laid out in rows. Posters with fictional characters and math operations plastered 
                    the walls.</p>

                    <p>We only got to be in there for an hour, so when it came down to the last few minutes, I 
                    would pursue to dread the incremental hours upon hours of math and English and the plethora of 
                    worksheets to come with it. 
                    “Jahrel, come on; the class is getting ready to leave. You’ve had enough time on the 
                    computers for today,” Mr. Engleman, my third grade teacher, said with an impatient tone in his 
                    voice.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Engleman was a middle-aged man, about 40 years old, who looked pretty young for 
                    his age. His 6-foot stature made him hover above everyone else, other teachers included, which 
                    made him look more intimidating than he actually was. The thing about him was that he liked to 
                    rush things. He would always hurry the class into a faster pace, which did not complement my 
                    laidback and calm nature.</p>

                    <p>“Just a few more minutes, please,” I pleaded, rapidly clicking the mouse trying to finish 
                    my online word search, “I’m almost done beating this level.” 
                    <br>
                    “No, the class is leaving now! Log off of your computer.” 
                    <br>
                    “Alright, fine,” I said, still clicking the mouse.</p>

                    <p>I dejectedly shut off my computer and rejoined with the rest of my class. My hyper eight-
                    year-old self kept checking the time every five minutes or so, waiting for it to be lunch and 
                    recess.</p>

                    <p>As we were in the middle of reviewing vocabulary words for English, my mind would 
                    revert back to the websites, visualizing the aesthetic aspect of each webpage and game. It seemed like an eternity before I got to go back to the computer lab once again. 
                    I sat back in my chair in my 9th grade GATE English course, reverting back to the drab 
                    reality that was freshman year of high school. I would always reminisce about the times of my 
                    childhood, getting lost in nostalgia.</p>
